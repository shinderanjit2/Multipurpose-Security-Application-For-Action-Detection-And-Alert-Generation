# Multipurpose-Security-Application-For-Action-Detection-And-Alert-Generation
This Python Open CV based application contains multiple security features known as modes. Each mode mode will provide distinct security, capture frame, make alert sound and store frame to local disk. It will automatically generate a log file for each activity captured based on mode. We used YOLO V3 datasets. We also achieved file handling.
